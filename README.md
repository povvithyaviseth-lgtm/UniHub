# UniHub Project.


UniHub is a campus club management platform where students, club owners, and 
administrators each have tailored tools to support engagement and organization.
Students can browse and join clubs, and view upcoming events on a personalized dashboard. 
Club owners can create and manage clubs, post announcements, schedule events, and track 
attendance. Administrators oversee platform activity by approving or removing clubs 
and managing student access to ensure a safe and organized environment.

UniHub follows the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, Node.js), separating the frontend client from 
the backend REST API. The backend handles authentication, user management, 
club/event logic, and communication with MongoDB. The frontend provides an interactive interface
where students, club owners, and admins can navigate their respective dashboards.
